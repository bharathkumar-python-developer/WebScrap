# Web Scraping

ðŸš€ Web Scraping Project using Python + SQLite

Just completed a hands-on data engineering project where I scraped, processed, and stored structured web data from a RESTful API!

âœ… Data Sources:

Users: /users

Posts: /posts

Comments: /comments


ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

Python for scripting

Requests for API interaction

SQLite3 for local data storage

Pandas (future-ready for analytics/visualization)


ðŸ“¦ Project Highlights:

Parsed complex nested JSON (e.g., addresses and company details).

Created and normalized 3 SQLite tables: users, posts, comments.

Ensured robust error handling with key-checking and fallback logging.

Used INSERT OR IGNORE for safe, duplicate-free storage.


ðŸ’¡ Use Case: This type of structured data extraction is foundational in building scalable data pipelines, real-time dashboards, and machine learning-ready datasets.

ðŸ”— Looking forward to expanding this into a full-stack data visualization dashboard!
